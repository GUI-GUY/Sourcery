# Sourcery
Automagically pulls source images from the internet to your PC

How to use:
1. Create a [SauceNao](https://saucenao.com/user.php) account, without it this application does not work
3. Go to options->SauceNao and insert your API-Key
4. Put the images you want to source in the input folder
5. Press the "Get Sources" Button
6. Wait
NOTE: SauceNao currently caps the requests you can make to 200 per day and 6 per 30 seconds for a free account. So if you want to source more than a few images, it's gonna take a little while
8. You can choose the images you want to keep and hit the save button OR
9. You can look at the images in a higher resolution in the big selector
10. If you put in an image that has been uploaded alongside many others a folder will be downloaded, if you check the folder every picture in it will be saved
11. If you want to stop the application from further sourcery, hit the stop button
