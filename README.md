# Sourcery
Automagically pulls source images from the internet to your PC

Tutorial:
1. Create a Pixiv and a SauceNao account, without it this application does not work
2. Go to options-> Provider and login with your pixiv login data
NOTE: Your pixiv login data will be saved in plain text(unencrypted) on your hard drive. If you don't want that you have two options:
    2.1 Don't use this application
    2.2 Login and source one or more pictures. From this process, a refresh-token will be created which can serve as future login data. You can thereafter change your login data in the application to anything else. (I don't know how long this refresh token lasts so you might need to login again a few days later)
    This will hopefully be changed by me in the future
3. Go to options->SauceNao and insert your API-Key which you can get from here https://saucenao.com/user.php?page=search-api 
4. Put the images you want to source in the input folder
5. Press the "Do Sourcery" Button
6. Wait
NOTE: SauceNao currently caps the requests you can make to 200 per day and 6 per 30 seconds for a free account. So if you want to source more than a few images, it's gonna take a while
7. Click the "View results" button to see the original images and the freshly downloaded images with some metadata.
8. You can choose the images you want to keep and hit one of the save button OR
9. You can look at the images in a higher resolution in the big selector
10. If you put in an image that has been uploaded alongside many others, a folder will be downloaded and you have to choose the one you want, or all of them. If you don't, the inpu image will be chosen and you wasted a request
11. If you want to stop the application from further sourcery, hit the stop button
