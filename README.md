# Sourcery
Automagically pulls source images from the internet to your PC

Tutorial:
1. Create a Pixiv and a SauceNao account, without it this application does not work
2. Go to options-> Provider and login with your pixiv login data
NOTE: Your pixiv login data will be saved in plain text(unencrypted) on your hard drive if you choose to save it:
3. Go to options->SauceNao and insert your API-Key which you can get from here https://saucenao.com/user.php?page=search-api 
4. Put the images you want to source in the input folder
5. Press the "Do Sourcery" Button
6. Wait
NOTE: SauceNao currently caps the requests you can make to 200 per day and 6 per 30 seconds for a free account. So if you want to source more than a few images, it's gonna take a while
8. You can choose the images you want to keep and hit the save button OR
9. You can look at the images in a higher resolution in the big selector
10. If you put in an image that has been uploaded alongside many others a folder will be downloaded, if you check the folder every picture in it will be saved
11. If you want to stop the application from further sourcery, hit the stop button
