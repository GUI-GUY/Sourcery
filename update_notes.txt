Update 0.3.1

Bugfixes:
- Request errors to SauceNao were not handled
- Weight system would choose wrong image because aspect ratio of two images differed slightly after the comma
- Big selector no longer shows images that weren't shown on the results screen
- If you checked none of the images in one set and told the program to delete them, it wouldn't do it, now it does
- Results screen now jumps back to the top after saving to avoid confusion
- Filenamelength now (hopefully) cannot overshoot the limit set by Windows 10

Update 0.3.2

- Fixed error where nonexistent path_original variable was called
- No more empty tagfile generation
- Fixed reference not holding the right input_path
- Fixed reference showing only input images when no sources were found
- Removed ability to change "Images per page" while gui is open since it produced a weird error
- Reworked reference loading. Uses a thread now which prevents the gui from freezing
- Put the update loop inside a thread to prevent the gui from lagging
- Fixed issue where all sourced images would be loaded into memory despite not putting them on screen (results screen)

- Capped images per page to 50 because too many would lead to Tkinter problems

- Reworked config file and handling for better readability
