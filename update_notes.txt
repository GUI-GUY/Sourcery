Update 0.3.1

Bugfixes:
- request errors to SauceNao were not handled
- weight system would choose wrong image because aspect ratio of two images differed slightly after the comma
- big selector no longer shows images that weren't shown on the results screen
- if you checked none of the images in one set and told the program to delete them, it wouldn't do it, now it does
- results screen now jumps back to the top after saving to avoid confusion
- filenamelength now (hopefully) cannot overshoot the limit set by Windows 10

Update 0.3.2

- Reduced padding in the results screen to better fit smaller screens
- Removed test button
